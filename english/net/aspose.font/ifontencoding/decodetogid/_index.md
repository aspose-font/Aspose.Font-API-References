description: Decodes a character code and returns glyph id. Glyph id is a unique number for a glyph which is font type dependent. For example Type1s id is a glyph name instance of GlyphStringIdaspose.font.glyphs/glyphstringid/ class. TTFs id is an int index instance of GlyphUInt32Idaspose.font.glyphs/glyphuint32id/ class. Note character code is not necessary a unicode. Character code is a char index in Font encoding table.

Decodes a character code and returns glyph id. Glyph id is a unique number for a glyph, which is font type dependent. For example: Type1's id is a glyph name, instance of ([`GlyphStringId`](../../../aspose.font.glyphs/glyphstringid/)) class. TTF's id is an int index, instance of ([`GlyphUInt32Id`](../../../aspose.font.glyphs/glyphuint32id/)) class. Note: character code is not necessary a unicode. Character code is a char index in Font encoding "table".

public GlyphId DecodeToGid(uint charCode)
```
