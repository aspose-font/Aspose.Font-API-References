## FontEnvironment.Strictness property

Some Fonts may contain unexpected data, non-specified features, or may be roughly cropped. Tolerant setting is recommended for consumers who want to open any font regardless possible Font's inadequacy. Font internal structures are not guaranteed to be consistent. Strict setting is recommended for consumers who want to open mostly valid and solid Fonts.

```csharp
public ParsingStrictness Strictness { get; set; }
```
