| [FontCharactersMerger](./fontcharactersmerger/) | Declares functionality to merge fonts of different types. Fonts pair is needed for merge operation. One font from this pair is considered as primary. It means that many characteristics, related to final merged font, such as metrics, encoding structure and others, will be taken from this primary font. Another font from this pair (secondary) provides only glyphs for final merged font. |
