## AssemblyConstants class


Defines the constants that participate in the license check for the component. These used to be defined directly as assembly attributes, but I moved them into separate class because in .NET Compact Framework I cannot access assembly attributes. Now the licensing code when compiled for the .NET Compact Framework uses these constants instead of the assembly attributes.

```cpp
class AssemblyConstants
```
