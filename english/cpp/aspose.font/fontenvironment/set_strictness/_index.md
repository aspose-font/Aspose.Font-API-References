## FontEnvironment::set_Strictness method


Some Fonts may contain unexpected data, non-specified features, or may be roughly cropped.

```cpp
void Aspose::Font::FontEnvironment::set_Strictness(FontEnvironment::ParsingStrictness value)
```

## Remarks


Tolerant setting is recommended for consumers who want to open any font regardless possible [Font](../../font/)'s inadequacy. [Font](../../font/) internal structures are not guaranteed to be consistent. Strict setting is recommended for consumers who want to open mostly valid and solid Fonts.
