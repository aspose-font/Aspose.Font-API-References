## FontEnvironment::get_Strictness method


Some Fonts may contain unexpected data, non-specified features, or may be roughly cropped.

```cpp
FontEnvironment::ParsingStrictness Aspose::Font::FontEnvironment::get_Strictness() const
```

## Remarks


Tolerant setting is recommended for consumers who want to open any font regardless possible [Font](../../font/)'s inadequacy. [Font](../../font/) internal structures are not guaranteed to be consistent. Strict setting is recommended for consumers who want to open mostly valid and solid Fonts.
