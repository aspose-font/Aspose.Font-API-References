For historical reasons, [Font](../../../aspose.font/font/) families have contained a maximum of four styles, but [Font](../../../aspose.font/font/) designers may group more than four fonts to a single family. The Preferred Family and Preferred Subfamily IDs allow [Font](../../../aspose.font/font/) designers to include the preferred family/subfamily groupings.

| WwsFamilyName | 21 | Used to provide a WWS-conformant family name in case the entries for IDs 16 and 17 do not conform to the WWS model. |
| WwsSubfamilyName | 22 | Used in conjunction with ID 21, this ID provides a WWS-conformant subfamily name (reflecting only weight, width and slope attributes) in case the entries for IDs 16 and 17 do not conform to the WWS model. |
| LightBackground | 23 | This ID, if used in the CPAL table’s Palette Labels Array, specifies that the corresponding color palette in the CPAL table is appropriate to use with the font when displaying it on a light background such as white. |
| DarkBackground | 24 | This ID, if used in the CPAL table’s Palette Labels Array, specifies that the corresponding color palette in the CPAL table is appropriate to use with the font when displaying it on a dark background such as black. |
